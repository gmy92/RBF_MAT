# RBF-MAT: Computing Medial Axis Transform from Point Clouds by Optimizing Radial Basis Functions

## üìÑ Project Overview

**RBF-MAT** is a method for computing the **Medial Axis Transform (MAT)** from point clouds using **Radial Basis Functions (RBFs)**. This approach involves selecting initial medial spheres from Voronoi vertices, optimizing their centers and radii iteratively, and constructing connectivity using a restricted power diagram.

### Key Features

- **Medial Axis Transform (MAT) Computation** from point clouds.
- **Radial Basis Functions (RBFs)** for surface reconstruction.
- **Restricted Power Diagram** for refining connectivity.
- Accurate approximation of point cloud surfaces.
